### TODO ###

 - Create an interaction script for two teams fighting each other [maybe just randomly hit another random person]
   - Add engage mechanic, so if one char attacks anther, the other must then continue to fight that one.
  (rather than all chars randomly hitting each other)
 - Create a scenario to do the two teams

 ?? hmmmm progression???



## DONE ##

 - Create folder structure [data => (characters), scripts => interactions, scenarios in base folder]
 - Create two characters in data/characters
 - Create a script for two characters fighting in interactions
 - Create a scenario that imports and calls the fight interaction with the two characters
